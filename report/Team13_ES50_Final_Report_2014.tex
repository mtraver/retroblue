        RetroBlue is a modern cell phone accessory with an old-timey feel. We took a vintage rotary phone, an Arduino board, and a Bluetooth chip and combined them to create RetroBlue, a fully functional Bluetooth accessory that can make, dial, and receive calls via a cell phone. A user simply pairs his or her cell phone with RetroBlue and all calls are then forwarded to the unit. We worked extensively to convert the antiquated circuitry within the phone to portable battery-powered components and developed custom code and circuitry to pass calls to and from the rotary phone's hardware.
